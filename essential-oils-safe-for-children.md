# Essential Oils Safe for Children

Please patch test first!


## From the John Hopkins reference below

* Anxiety. Lavender, chamomile, basil and Frankincense can help with anxiety. Sweet orange can help with uplifting.
* Nausea and fatigue. Peppermint (for children over 30 months old), ginger and mandarin can help ease nausea symptoms.
* Headaches. Peppermint can help with headaches for children over 30 months old.
* Insect repellent. Basil oil has been known to help repel insects. Citronella is an insecticide. Avoid using it on children younger than 6 months.
* Insomnia. Lavender can help.

## From the pedeatric guide reference below

* Allergies - Lemon, Lavender, Peppermint, mixed together in equal part 
* Scrapes or cuts - Melaleuca (Tea Tree), Lavender, Frankincense. You can make a spray in a 10 ml glass spray bottle with water and 10 drops of each.
* Respiratory support - blends containing Eucalyptus, Peppermint, Lemon, and Melaleuca (Tea Tree) oils 
* Ear pain - Melaleuca essential oil, diluted and applied around the ears, 3-4 times per day. Garlic oil, one drop in the ear 3x a day.
* Eye discomfort - Lavender can be diluted and applied around the eye socket.
* Sore throats - Protective blends containing Orange, Clove, Cinnamon, Eucalyptus, and Rosemary for gargling. Mouthful of warm water in a shot-sized glass and add 2-5 drops of a protective blend. 
* Immune system support and surface cleansing - same protective blends mentioned above 
* Teething - diluted lavender oil applied along the jawline 
* Attention and focus - a focus blend containing Amyris, Patchouli, Frankincense, Lime, Ylang Ylang, Sandalwood, and Chamomile. Apply diluted to the wrists. Also consider Vetiver, Frankincense, Lemon, or Cedarwood essential oils alone or in combination.
* Healthy sleep or calming - reassuring blends of Vetiver, Lavender, Ylang Ylang, Frankincense, Clary Sage, Marjoram, Labdanum and Spearmint 
* Behavioral/emotional -  Cedarwood helps improve connections with others. Geranium is great for adapting to new situations or for transitions between activities. Juniper Berry is great for calming night terrors or for helping when loud noises cause distress. Bergamot calms agitation, improves appetite, and calms emotional stress. Sandalwood quiets the mind and is great in the middle of a meltdown.

## Essential oils NOT SAFE for kids under 2 (diffusion usually safe unless otherwise noted)

For safe oils, use a 2-3% dilution or lower.

Most of these are indicated unsafe just for topical application due to the stronger nature of the oil as well as possible skin reactions. Technically they are safe for diffusing unless otherwise noted.  I commented where there’s explicit safety concern for diffusing. However, as a practice I steer clear of them for both topical and diffusing since there are other, gentler oils I can use for the younger kids. If there is a small amount of one of them in a pre-made blend I am diffusing I may still diffuse it, but using a smaller amount.

Oils high in 1,8 cineole can be dangerous for young children.)
